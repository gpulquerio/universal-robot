## Quickstart

Test the interface with a simulated Universal Robot from dockerhub "universalrobots/ursim_e-series"

Set this up by installing docker and running `docker compose -f "./examples/simulator/docker-compose.yaml" up --build`.

Then run the example with `cargo run --example demo`.

Run tests with `cargo test -- --test-threads=1` to stop it trying to paralellize the tests (which rely on the same hardware).

## Introduction

The Universal Robot can be controlled at two levels:

* The PolyScope or the Graphical User Interface Level
* Script Level

At the Script Level, the URScript is the programming language that controls the robot.
The URScript includes variables, types, and the flow control statements. There are also
built-in variables and functions that monitor and control I/O and robot movements.

## Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE)

The RTDE synchronize external executables with the UR controller, for instance URCaps, without breaking any real-time properties.

The Real-Time Data Exchange (RTDE) interface provides a way to synchronize external applications with the UR controller over a standard TCP/IP connection, without breaking any real-time properties of the UR controller. This functionality is among others useful for interacting with drivers (e.g. Ethernet/IP), manipulating robot I/O and plotting robot status (e.g. robot trajectories). The RTDE interface is by default available when the UR controller is running. The synchronization is configurable and can for example involve the following data:

* Output: robot-, joint-, tool- and safety status, analog and digital I/O's and general purpose output registers
* Input: digital and analog outputs and general purpose input registers
  
The RTDE functionality is split in two stages: a setup procedure and a synchronization loop.

On connection to the RTDE interface, the client is responsible for setting up the variables to be synchronized. Any combination of input and output registers that the client needs to write and read, respectively, can be specified. To achieve this the client sends a setup list of named input and output fields that should be contained in the actual data synchronization packages. The definition of a synchronization data package format is referred to as a recipe. There is a maximum limit of 2048 bytes to represent the list of inputs/outputs field names a client would like to subscribe to. In return the RTDE interface replies with a list of the variable types or specifies that a specific variable has not been found. Each input recipe that has been successfully configured will get a unique recipe id. The list of supported field names and their associated data types can be found below. When the setup is complete the data synchronization can be started and paused.

When the synchronization loop is started, the RTDE interface sends the client the requested data in the same order it was requested by the client. Furthermore the client is expected to send updated inputs to the RTDE interface on a change of value. The data synchronization uses serialized data.

All packages share the same general structure with a header and a payload if applicable. The packages used for the setup procedure generate a return message. The synchronization loop packages do not. Both client and server may at any time send a text message, whereby the warning level specifies the severity of the problem. The RTDE is available on port number 30004.

### Key Features

* **Real-time synchronization:** The RTDE generally generates output messages on 125 Hz. However, the real-time loop in the controller has a higher priority than the RTDE interface. Therefore, if the controller lacks computational resources it will skip a number of output packages. The skipped packages will not be sent later, the controller will always send the most recent data. Input packages will always be processed in the control cycle they are received, so the load for the controller will vary depending on the number of received packages.
* **Input messages:** The updating of variables in the controller can be divided into multiple messages. One can have one message to update everything or a message per variable or any division in between. There is no need for a constant update rate; inputs keep their last received value. Note: Only one RTDE client is allowed to control a specific variable at any time.
Runtime environment: An RTDE client may run on the UR Control Box PC or on any external PC. The advantage of running the RTDE client on the Control Box is no network latency. However, the RTDE client and UR controller will compete for computational resources. Please make sure that the RTDE client runs with standard operating system priority. Computationally intensive processes, e.g. image processing, should be run on an external PC.
* **Protocol changes:** The RTDE protocol might be updated at any time by UR. To guarantee maximum compatibility for your RTDE client, RTDE clients can request the RTDE interface to speak a specific protocol version. Protocol additions / changes are explicitly denoted, otherwise version 1 is assumed.
